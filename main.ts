/*
 * This project was created using arcade-sprite-pack. If you
 * want to publish this project to GitHub as a sprite pack, do
 * not add any code to this file! The code that is running in the
 * simulator can be edited by clicking on the file explorer to the
 * left and selecting "test.ts". Any code added to "test.ts" will
 * not be added to a project that imports this sprite pack as an
 * extension.
 *
 * If you don't wish to publish this project, you can use this project
 * as-is. Your sprites should show up in the sprite gallery. Make sure
 * you delete the code in "test.ts"!
 *
 *
 * To publish this project to GitHub:
 *   1. Rename this project to something descriptive
 *   2. Click the GitHub button in the bottom bar next to the save
 *      button (sign in to GitHub if prompted)
 *   3. Choose a name for your repository. This is the name that
 *      people will see when importing your project.
 *   4. Make sure "public repository" is selected in the dropdown
 *      if you want other people to be able to use your sprites
 *   5. Click "go ahead"
 *   6. If you are on a shared computer, make sure you sign out of
 *      GitHub!
 *
 *
 * To add a published project to an Arcade project:
 *   1. Inside the MakeCode editor, click "Extensions" under "Advanced"
 *      in the toolbox
 *   2. Inside the search box that appears, type your GitHub username
 *      followed by a "/" and the name of the repository. It should
 *      look something like this: username/repository
 *   3. Hit enter on your keyboard and click the card that appears
 *   4. The sprites should now show up in the gallery of the sprite
 *      editor (at the bottom)
